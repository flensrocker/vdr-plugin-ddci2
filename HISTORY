VDR Plugin 'ddci2' Revision History
----------------------------------

2014-03-28: Version 0.0.4

- Intermediate commit before HW tests are starting:
  * Added newest GPLv2 COPYING file.
  * The dependencies are now recreated, if a source file changes.
  * README improved.
  * Added file headers to all source files.
  * The plugin is now ready to find the DD CI device files and to initialize
    them. It will communicate viw the .../caX device to the CAM.
    NOTE: The .../ciX device is currently not used! So you do still need the
          drivers redirect feature to get a descambled stream.
