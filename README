Description:

A plugin which creates DVB CI adapters from "stand alone" ca-devices
like the ones from Digital Devices.
This plugin will work only with VDR version 2.1.6 and newer.

The CI devices of the Digital Devices or Linux4Media are not bound to
a dedicated DVB adapter. There will be only a ca- and a ci-device.
The ca-device has to used like every other ca-device, but the packets
to be descrambled have to be written to and read from the ci-device.
This plugin obsolets the redirect method of the ddbridge kernel driver.
